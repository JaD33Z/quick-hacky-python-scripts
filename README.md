# quick-hacky-python-scripts
Some quick pentest tools I've thrown together that were useful.  

A hacking tools repo to add to and expand on over time. Scripts I put together in special use cases, for pentests, ctf's, etc.
With a little room for tweaking, they can be applied wherever they may come in handy for the specific target.
Use only in circumstances where you have permission.
